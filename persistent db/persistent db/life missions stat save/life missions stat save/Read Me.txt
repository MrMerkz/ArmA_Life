Life missions stat saver:

You must have some experience with Arma 2 scripting to be able to install this.

Installation:

1 - Put the 'lifeserver' folder in your Arma 2 server installation folder.

2 - In your mission folder(unpacked pbo), put the loadclient.sqf and saver.sqf.

3 - In your init.sqf add the following lines.
	Within the if(isServer) statement put		[] execVM "lifeserver\init.sqf";
	Within the if(!isDedicated) statement put	[] execVM "saver.sqf";		and		[] execVM "loadclient.sqf";

4 - Edit your savevarfuncs.sqf to match the given one more or less.
	look at lines 24-26, 28, 52-55, 61-84.
	
5 - (OPTIONAL) In your clientloop.sqf. Modify it to save commonly used variables more oftenly to prevent items or money not saving directly after purchases etc.

6 - In the 'lifeserver' folder in rewards.sqf, you can add Player IDs to give donators/vip players extra salary bonuses.

7 - run the server.

8 - run WasteLand PersistentDB.exe from inside the lifeserver folder. (create a shortcut).
Optional - If you don't want to manually flush the stats, just add -flush to the shortcut parameter. example: "path/to/WasteLand PersistentDB.exe" - flush

9 - when you close the arma 2 server, click stop and flush on the WasteLand PersistentDB.exe.

10 - start the arma 2 server and click start on the WasteLand PersistentDB.exe.
/////////////////////////////////////////

Tip: To make this server automated, just kill the WasteLand PersistentDB.exe together with the server and start it together again with the -flush parameter.


If you failed to get this working, you don't have enough experience with Arma 2 scripting.
